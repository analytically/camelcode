CamelCode [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/analytically/camelcode.png)](https://travis-ci.org/analytically/camelcode)
=========

A tech demo built using [Play! 2.1](http://www.playframework.org/) that imports the
[CodePoint Open](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html) UK postcode dataset
and offers a Geocoding RESTful API and a map. It also demonstrates how
[Google Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/) can be integrated in a Play 2.1 Java application.

Prerequisites: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and [Play! 2.1](http://www.playframework.org/).

Development sponsored by [Coen Recruitment](http://www.coen.co.uk). Follow [@analytically](http://twitter.com/analytically) on Twitter for updates.

Setup
-----

Edit `conf/application.conf` and point it to a MongoDB installation, and execute

```
play run
```

Then put the [CodePoint Open CSVs](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html) (scroll halfway down, 20mb)
in the `codepointopen` directory.

After they are processed, they will be moved to the `codepointopen/done` directory.

Then visit [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) and you should see the welcome screen.
Visit [http://localhost:9000/servermetrics](http://localhost:9000/servermetrics) for server metrics.

JSON
----

GET [http://localhost:9000/latlng/POSTCODE](http://localhost:9000/latlng/BS106TF) to geocode a UK postcode. Response will be JSON:

```json
{"latitude":51.505615,"longitude":-2.6120315}
```

Technology
----------

* [Play! 2.1](http://www.playframework.org/), thank god for this!
* [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) to [process and monitor](https://github.com/analytically/camelcode/blob/master/app/Global.java#L103) the `codepointopen` directory and to tell the actors about the postcodes (split(body()))
* [Akka 2.1](http://akka.io/) provides a nice concurrent model [to process the 1.7 million postcodes](https://github.com/analytically/camelcode/blob/master/app/actors/ProcessCPOCsvEntry.java) in under one minute on modern hardware
* [GeoTools 8](http://www.geotools.org/) [converts](https://github.com/analytically/camelcode/blob/master/app/actors/ProcessCPOCsvEntry.java) the eastings/northings to latitude/longitude
* [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/) for [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/analytically/camelcode/blob/master/app/Global.java#L53) (not too much to inject yet though)
* [Metrics](https://github.com/codahale/metrics) for metrics
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as database with two-dimensional geospatial indexes (see [Geospatial Indexing](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing))
* [Morphia](http://code.google.com/p/morphia/) for 'Object-Document Mapping'
* [Leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/) for the map
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) for the UI
